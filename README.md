# My Portfolio ❤️

Personal professional portfolio made in [Cvless theme](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) for static websites built with Jekyll. It aims for simplicity and readability by following best practices of graphic design, like the use of [high contrast](https://www.contrastrebellion.com), [law of proximity](https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity), and responsive layout. Its typography is based on  [Jetbrain Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/#font-family), which performs extremely well over a wide range of font sizes.
