# About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm a computer engineering graduate with a master's degree in computer engineering and 4 years of experience in web and back-end development. While I haven't formally held leadership roles, I've made significant decisions in teams and projects, playing an influential role in decision-making. My passion for development is complemented by my superpower of quick learning and being self-taught, enabling me to thrive in various work environments and business areas. 

I'm energetic and committed, enjoy teamwork, and possess soft and organizational skills. I handle pressure situations with ease, am adept at multitasking, and appreciate clean code, with experience in agile methodologies. 

I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate with you and contribute to new projects 😁
